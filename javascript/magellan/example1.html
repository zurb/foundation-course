      <p>Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.</p>

      <p>Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the  wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the  Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the  door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p>

      <p>Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p>

      <p>'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for  two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you  are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could  possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise  going on within&mdash;a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then  a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p>

      <p>'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'</p>

      <p>'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on  without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this  Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.&mdash;How am I to get in?' she  repeated, aloud.</p>
